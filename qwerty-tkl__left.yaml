  # kx/ky is the layout space used to position edge-to-edge,
  # for example using cherry mx as a guide:
  # a cherry mx switch pcb plate hole is 14x14,
  # a keycap is 18x18,
  # but the size to use for laying out edge to edge (taking into account gaps between switches/keycaps) is 19.05mm
  kx: 19.05
  ky: 19.05

  # make the ergogen web preview
  # SHOULD MATCH `kx/ky`

  # capX/capY is the size of a key cap
  capX: 18
  capY: 18

  # swHoleX/swHoleY is the size of a keyswitch
  swHoleX: 14

  # paddedX/paddedY is a sizing used to produce the case, the padding is used to provide an outer space around the edge of all keys
