UNITS
- use units to define vars for layout (like key size and then a padded key size for pcb layout)

POINTS
- a point is the x,y co-ord of the center of a key (plus r for rotation)

ZONE
- a group of points is a zone. but this is defined in the following structure 
    `/points/zones/{section}/columns`
    `/points/zones/{section}/rows`

MATRIX
- a matrix is a table of columns and rows

GOTCHA #1!
- ergogen is all about ortholiner where the vertical columns of keys are straight lines but adjacent columns maybe be vertically staggered matching your finger lengths

- this is a problem as I am going conventional where the horizontal rows are straight lines but they stagger horizontally.
    - to make this work in ergo gen world I am just going to flip my cols and rows and do everything at 90 degrees and then declare `matrix.anchor.rotate: -90` to make it render where i expect

CONFUSING POINT #1!
- the way that ergogen procedurally renders layouts is essentially `for(col of cols) { for (row of rows) { } }` where the columns start at the left and progress to the right and rows start at the bottom of a column and progress upwards
